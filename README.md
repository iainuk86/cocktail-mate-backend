# 🍸 🍾 Cocktail Mate Backend 🍾 🍸

Simple Rest API built to handle all requests from Cocktail Mate.  
Communicates with a cloud-hosted database to fetch necessary data.  

# 🛠️ Implementation 🛠️

The core project is written in C#.  
Uses ASP.NET Core to implement the controller logic.  
Uses the Entity Framework ORM to map various entities to their database equivalents.  
Separate from the frontend and fully containerised.
Was previously hosted on AWS, but I am currently going through a provider migration.
